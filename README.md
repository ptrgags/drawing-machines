# Drawing Machines: GitHub Pages Branch

Peter Gagliardi (ptrgags@gmail.com)

This branch is the "production" copy of the code, since this will be hosted
at https://ptrgags.github.io/drawing-machines or 
https://ptrgags.dev/drawing-machines

During October 2019, I will publish a new drawing machine demo on this branch
every day as an alternate to the Inktober drawing challenge.
